###Reference the Yellow Numbers for Screen Numbers

![Screens 1 - 4](https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/C2.17_fitbit_companion/tree/junior_devs/imgs/screens1-4.png)

####Slack the page you're working on

#### Convert These Wireframes to HTML

####Steps to Take:

- The base everyone should work off of will be the ```html_skeleton``` folder
- Choose a page to work on and let everyone know in the Slack channel (so multiple people don't tackle the same thing)
- Make a new branch ( ```git checkout -b ____``` ) from ```junior_devs``` with the name of the page/feature you're working on (ex: ```screen_1```) and go into that folder to work on it
- Git add and commit as normal
- Once you feel the screen is done PULL REQUEST to ```junior_devs``` <strong>NOT</strong> master 
- We'll review it and merge as necessary
