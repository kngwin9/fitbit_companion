###Reference the Yellow Numbers for Screen Numbers

####Slack the page you're working on

#####Note:
- Sign up and sign in are very similar so make one and make the other in the same branch (example branches: ```screen1``` or ```sign_up_screen``` can have both, just two different files).

#### Convert These Wireframes to HTML

####Steps to Take:

- The base everyone should work off of will be the ```html_skeleton``` folder
- Choose a page to work on and let everyone know in the Slack channel (so multiple people don't tackle the same thing)
- Make a new branch ( ```git checkout -b ____``` ) from ```junior_devs``` with the name of the page/feature you're working on (ex: ```screen_1```) and go into that folder to work on it
- Git add and commit as normal
- Once you feel the screen is done PULL REQUEST to ```junior_devs``` <strong>NOT</strong> master 
- We'll review it and merge as necessary
