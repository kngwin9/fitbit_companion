# Junior Dev HTML/CSS Work

#### Convert These Wireframes to HTML

####Steps to Take:

- Clone this repo (if you haven't already)
- ```Git pull origin master``` (to pull the new changes and folders)
- Git checkout to ```junior_devs``` (the branch you'll pull request to and where everything for you is)
- The base everyone should work off of will be the ```html_skeleton``` folder
- Choose a page to work on and let everyone know in the Slack channel (so multiple people don't tackle the same thing)
- Make a new branch ( ```git checkout -b ____``` ) from ```junior_devs``` with the name of the page/feature you're working on (ex: ```screen_1```) and go into that folder to work on it
- Git add and commit as normal
- Once you feel the screen is done PULL REQUEST to ```junior_devs``` <strong>NOT</strong> master 
- We'll review it and merge as necessary

* - Don't worry about actual text/images right now, just use dummy text and SFW images
